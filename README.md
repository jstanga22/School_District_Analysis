# School_District_Analysis
Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the reading and math scores for all grades across the various schools within the district. Once this was accomplished the data could be further broken down to see how school budgets and spending per student affected these reading and math scores. 
Results:
In summary it can be determined that the schools with a larger budget, and thus spend more per student score higher in the subjects of math and reading in comparison to their less affluent counter parts. 
Thomas High School Effect:
THomas High School was a high budget, high test scores charter school. Replacing the 9th grade scores with NaN greatly reduced the average test scores of the school, and consequently they are not performing so far ahead of their counter part schools. This change brought down the scores by grade, by school spending, and by school type. Thomas was in the bottom half of schools by size so this category was not as heavily affected. 
Summary:
The Thomas High School 9th grade scores skewed our data to favor more heavily affluent, charter schools. Originally it showed that higher scores weere attributed to higher spending per student and charter schools with a large budget and smaller student population. When replacing the errant scores the data still shows that this assumption is true, it is significantly less obvious than it was with the 9th grade scores included in the data.
